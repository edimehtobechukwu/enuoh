Project Name: Moving Brands Forward — Enuoh Creative Co.
Concept A high-octane, motion-centric portfolio website for a Quebec-based digital agency. The site rejects traditional corporate sterility in favor of a "Brutalist Modern" aesthetic—bold, unapologetic, and focused on raw impact. It bridges the gap between experimental motion design and functional e-commerce.

Visual Identity

Palette: Deep Void Black (#0a0a0a), Industrial Concrete (#f5f5f0), and High-Visibility Safety Orange (#ff4d00).
Typography: Oswald (primary) for aggressive, condensed headlines that demand attention, paired with Consolas (secondary) for technical, data-driven accents.
Imagery: A mix of clean UI mockups, grainy founder photography, and abstract 3D chrome shapes.
Key Features Implemented

Immersive Hero Section: Features a split-screen layout with 3D abstract compositions and a simulated "blur" aura, anchored by massive responsive typography.
Infinite Marquee: A seamless, self-correcting scrolling loop featuring stylized SVG logos (DEHIT, BOOMBOX®, KASTLE) that mimics a high-end client roster.
Interactive Galleries:
Work Grid: A responsive masonry-style layout mixing video placeholders and static case studies.
Draggable Testimonials: A physics-based carousel powered by Framer Motion allowing users to "grab and throw" cards.
Responsive Navigation:
Desktop: A floating glassmorphism pill navbar.
Mobile: A complete takeover overlay with staggered text animations and integrated social hubs.
Digital Store: A functional grid layout for selling design assets (Fonts, UI Kits, Motion Presets).
Tech Stack

Framework: React (Vite)
Styling: Tailwind CSS v4.0
Animation: Motion (Framer Motion) for complex orchestrations (scroll triggers, layout transitions, physics).
Routing: React Router DOM (v6)
